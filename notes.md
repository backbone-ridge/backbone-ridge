# Transcription guidelines

Text transcription should be literal letter-for-letter transcription.

Use square brackets around any added text expansion/explanation/correction.

In general, don't correct original spelling errors.  If the original spelling is confusing, add the correct spelling in square brackets.
Don't add clarifying notes if not sure.

If there is an incorrect page reference, provide the correction in brackets.

Sections that should be converted to additional observation rows in the data table can be highlighted using a blue text color.  These additional rows will only exist in the data table, not the transcription.

References to corners should be formatted like `[37NE]`



Create a glossary of common abbreviations.

1 chain = 66 feet = 100 links
