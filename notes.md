# Transcription guidelines

Text transcription should be literal letter-for-letter transcription, with capitalization following the original:

```
a Brook runing NWly
```

Use square brackets around any added text expansion/explanation/correction.

```
is also light and open woods Timber as Said befor [Black and white Oak]
```

In general, don't correct original spelling errors.  If the original spelling is particularly confusing, add the correct spelling in square brackets.  Common abbreviations will be included in a glossary.

Don't add clarifying notes if not sure.  (Or possibly add a a question mark to indicate uncertainty.)

If there is an incorrect page reference, provide the correction in brackets:

```
as previously described on page 27 [page 29]
```

Text that has been crossed out can be notated with double tildes before and after the struct text:
```
a Stake Standing four links ~~West~~ East from a Black Oak Tree
```

On the website, this will be rendered as:
> a Stake Standing four links ~~West~~ East from a Black Oak Tree

Sections that should be converted to additional observation rows in the data table can be highlighted using a blue text color.  These additional rows will only exist in the data table, not the transcription.

References to corners should be encoded as follows:
```
To the SE Corner of this lot describe in this page last above [37SE]
```


## Other notes

1 chain = 66 feet = 100 links

Photos -- do points need an ID?  Then photo filenames for the same place could be like `pointid123-1.jpg`, `pointid123-2.jpg`
